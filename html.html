            <b><h7>I love computers! I have always had a passion for how new technology works. I took classes in high school and also grade school involving computer skills. Computers are a way of knowledge and a key road to the future. I love learning new things about them and also what I can do with the new knowledge that I learn. There is so much to offer in this field and I hope to get a job right out of college. I hope that I can accomplish success in this course and see all that it has to offer.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">I am a student of NKU. I am a senior this year and expect to graduate in the fall of 2017. My favorite tv show is Body of Proof. It is a show about a medical examiner and the mysteries that happened to the bodies. My favorite book is Me Before You. My favorite food is pizza or any Italian food! I love country music! Dolly Parton is my favorite! It is my favorite genre of music. My favorite color is purple. When I am feeling down, I take a shower and have something to eat. I feel that I get better faster with these two things. Graduation in my near future is making me happy these days! Also my family, friends and my boyfriend make me very happy! I am part of the 10% of the world that is left handed. I want you to remember that I give my absolute best in everything that I do! I am motivated in my career path, and am very excited for my future.</h3>
        <h8><b>            I am very adventurous! Three summers ago I went Skydiving in Middletown, Ohio. I love going parasailing, jet skiing, and swimming with wild animals. This past summer I went to Hawaii on vacation with my family. I got to experience swimming with wild dolphins and also wild turtles. It was an experience of a lifetime and I will never forget it. There are so many things out in the world that I would like to experience. I would love to travel the globe. Next summer, I am planning a trip to India. I love traveling and hope to have a career that will allow me to travel!
